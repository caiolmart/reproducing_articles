# Reproducing Articles

As part of a course I am taking in the University of SÃ£o Paulo - Advanced Topics in Data Science for Computer Networks (MAC6958-2020) - I have to reproduce some articles of the field.

The first one, `modelling_delays`, was chosen from the _ACM SIGCOMM 2018 Workshop on Big Data Analytics and Machine Learning for Data Commu-nication Networks (Big-DAMA 2018)_ that can be found on the link:

The second one, `node_centrality` was chosen from a collection of articles from _IEEE INFOCOM 2019 Workshop on Network Intelligence (NI2019)_ that can be found on the link:

Maybe I will reproduce more articles here in the future.
