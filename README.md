# Reproducing Articles

This is a personal project that I started as part of a course I took at the University of SÃ£o Paulo - Advanced Topics in Data Science for Computer Networks (MAC6958-2020) in which I had to reproduce two articles in the field of Computer Networks. I am extending this as a way of making some experiments for my Master thesis.

The first one, `modelling_delays`, was chosen from the _ACM SIGCOMM 2018 Workshop on Big Data Analytics and Machine Learning for Data Commu-nication Networks (Big-DAMA 2018)_ that can be found on the link:

The second one, `node_centrality` was chosen from a collection of articles from _IEEE INFOCOM 2019 Workshop on Network Intelligence (NI2019)_ that can be found on the link:

The third one, `gnn_jpmorgan` "Classifying and Understanding Financial Data
Using Graph Neural Network" was chosen from my interests in GNNs. It can be found here:
